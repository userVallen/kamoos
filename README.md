# Overview

A simple English web dictionary made with React + Vite. All dictionary data is provided by [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/). This simple project is made with the objective of exploring the basics of API calling using React's fetch() function and handling the data returned as a response. Additionally, implementations of raw CSS animations were also introduced in this project.
